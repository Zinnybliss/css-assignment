    <h3>My Tech Journey</h3>
    <p>My name is Ezinne Chiwueze and I'm very passionate about Tech. i first learnt about Tech during my service,
        I was with a tech firm, and they use Saas, I was curious, I wanted to understand how this service works as opposed to doing my regular administrative job
      My quest and curiosity were not satisfied, hence I continued with my administrative jobs, 5 years down the line and I had to quit administration to venture 
      into Tech fully, in order to understand how this tech cycle works and also contribute my own quota towards its improvements.

    <h3>Importance of Css</h3>
    <p>I have come to the realization of the following whilst using Css 
        <ul>
            <li>Css makes a page beautiful</li>
            <li>The different colour patterns and its attributes are amazing</li>
            <li>Understanding css is quite simple.</li>
        </ul>
        With the above listed, i enjoy writing css and see my work being brought to life.

    <h3>Difference between padding, Margin and border</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Paddings: These are the inner space between the content and the border of your box.</li>
            <li>Margin: Margins are spaces around an element's border.</li>
            <li>Border: Immediately after the padding, you get the border and these separates the padding and the margin.
            </li>
        </ol>
